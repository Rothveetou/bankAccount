Exercise-18

Define the class bankAccount to implement the basic properties of a bank account. An object of this class should store the following data:

Account holderâ€™s name (string), account number (int), account type (string, checking/saving), balance (double), and interest rate (double). 
(Store interest rate as a decimal number.)

Add appropriate member functions to manipulate an object. Use a static member in the class to automatically assign account numbers. 
Also declare an array of 10 components of type bankAccount to process up to 10 customers and write a program to illustrate how to use your class.
